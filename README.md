# Assignment 24

For this assignment you will prompt the user for the number of sides on a die and how many times it will be rolled. Your program should roll that many times and store the number of times each value is rolled in an array.

## Specifications

You have the choice of using either one or multiple classes. However, if you use one class you still need to break up your code logically into methods.

Use the example from last class to guide you as you get started.

### Sample Outputs

```
How many sides does the die have? 6
How many rolls? 1000

1: 159
2: 159
3: 171
4: 163
5: 165
6: 183
```

```
How many sides does the die have? 10
How many rolls? 50

1: 10
2: 5
3: 6
4: 5
5: 12
6: 2
7: 2
8: 7
9: 3
10: 3
```

## Part 2

For part 2 you will output a simple graph of the number of times each number was rolled.

You should have labels for both axes. The frequency on the y-axis should increment at a constant rate (+/- 1 error).

Using the escape sequence for tabs (`'\t'`) will be very useful. Also, remember that the escape sequence `'\n'` will return your output to the next line.

Example:
`System.out.print("Hello there. \nMy name is Mr. King. \nHave a nice day!");`

Output:
```
Hello there.
My name is Mr. King.
Have a nice day!
```

Example:
`System.out.print("1\t2\t3\n15\t30\t45");`

Output:
```
1   2   3
15  30  45
```

### Sample Outputs

```
How many rolls? 100
1: 23
2: 18
3: 16
4: 14
5: 12
6: 17

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style.
